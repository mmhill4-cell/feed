                <h2> Diabetes Vocab</h2>
                <blockquote> As I was making this I realised it may be important for non-diabetcs to actually understand what im saying! So this page is vocab/what you need to know about so you can understand what's going on in the feed! 
                    <br>
                   <small> (Also lot's of this is subjective because everyone's body is different! But this is my personal expirience.)</small></blockquote>
                
                <ul>

                    <li><b>Type One </b> - Also known as Diabetes Mellitus type one is the kind of diabetes I have. It's an autoimmune disease so essentially my bodys immune system wasn't strong enough to keep my pancreas alive. There are many different kinds of diabetes this is the second most common after type 2 diabetes. Type one usually is most common is children under 10 giving it the nickname Juvenille diabetes.  </li>

                    <br>

                    <li> <b>Blood sugar </b>- The level of sugar in the blood stream, the goal for those with diabetes is to stay between 80-120.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>High blood sugar</b> - sugar levels above 180 (This can kind of be subjective though everyones body is different). Usually symptoms include fatigue, nausea, excessive thirst, and dry mouth. In serious cases this can lead to vomiting, loss of conciousness, loosing circulation in body parts, and DKA</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Low blood sugar </b>- sugar levels under 70 (This is also subjective everyone has differnt symptoms). Usually symptoms include excessive sweating, hunger, dizziness, involuntary shaking, and blurred vision or difficulty focusing. In serious cases this can lead to loss of conciousness, seizure, or coma. </li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>DKA </b>- Diabetic Ketoacidosis is when the body doesn't have enough insulin so it begins to breakdown fat for energy. This creates keytones which gather in the blood making it acidic. (yes it feels as bad as it sounds!) </li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Insulin pump</b>- medical equipment that administers insulin and calculates doses based on blood sugar and grams of carbs. I change this site every three days. I use a Tandem Tslim but i use dto use a Rebel One Medtronic. There are many brands out there it all depends on your preference.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Dexcom/CGM </b>- continous glucose monitor that reads my blood sugar every five mintues and sends a blue tooth signal to my pump. I change this site every 10 days,I use a Dexcom G6 (yes like the song) but there are lots of other brands out there.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Manual Check </b>- Before I had a dexcom I used a meter that I would put a test strip in. then i would prick my finger with a small needle called a lancet and put a drop of blood onto the test strip which would tell me my blood sugar. I prefer a CGM though because I dont have to prick my finger every two hours.</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Tslim app </b>- App on my iphone linked to my pump through bluetooth which allows me to check my blood sugar and give insulin through my phone. This came out within the past 3-4 years and I still can't get over it. </li>

                    <br>

                    <li> <b>Bolus</b> - Giving myself insulin</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Basal </b>- Constant stream of insulin administered through my insulin pump</li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Carbs </b>- Sugar molecules that also include protien and fats. I take insulin to be able to break them down into energy. Diabetics have to count t he carbs of every meal they eat and calculate it using a specific formula designed for their body so they can figure out how many units of insulin to take.</li>

                    <br>
                   
                    
                    <li><b>Insulin on Board</b> - The amount of insulin currently active in the body.</li>
                    
                    <br>

                    <li><b>Parameters</b> - My highest and lowest numbers I allow my blood sugar to get to before my pump sends an alarm. (I set them wide because the alarm goes off every five minutes and I already run high and I will go crazy if it keeps beeping.)</li>

                    <br>
                    
                    <li><b>Spike </b>- When blood sugar goes up durastically. </li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Protein</b> - Protien helps to slow the digestion of carbs. Overall it helps with evening out bloodsugar. Some people calculate grams of protein into their insulin dosage because of it's ability to slow digestion. </li>

                    <br>

                    <li><b>Control IQ</b> - A setting on the Tandem Tslim insulin pump that uses an algorithim to adjust the current basal rate. Essentially it takes care of blood sugar corrections throughout your day so mostly you only have to dose for carbs. </li>
